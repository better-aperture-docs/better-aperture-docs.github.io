# Aperture

## What is Aperture?

Aperture is a fork of former Discord employee b1nzy's Rowboat.
> "Rowboat is a multi-purpose moderation and utility bot for Discord. It was built to help maintain and moderate extremely large servers and thus it bears a unique and refined feature-set.

Aperture and it's team plan to uphold that same goal, but expand upon its range of features and addons that are given to it.
